# Movie vs Movie
### Application Overview
In the first phase of this application, we can compare two movies at one time.

### Idea
A user is going to search for a movie on the left hand search input and a different on the right hand search input. So user will type in some movie title and we're going to fetch some information about that movie.
> The two inputs are not going to be the normal inputs. Instead we're going to make them into kind of auto complete inputs.
