# Dynamic Page Using Javascript*

### Another mini project where we are using wallpaper depending on current time of the day. It will change if it is night | day. To do this, we are using four primary functions

1. setBgScreen()
    - to set dynamic background
2. showTime()
    - to show dynamic time
3. getName()
    - to show current user name
4. getFocus()
    - to select the current input

### We are saving the data in localhost of the browser to show the username and agenda on the screen.
